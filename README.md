# Simple-Aim-Trainer
A simple high-score game where the player has limited time to click circles
that appear in a random position on the screen. The player is able to see
the gameplay results after each round.

Features to be added:
 - Store highest scores ever achieved through object serialization
 - Ability to change the round time

Current Issues:
 - The program minimizes when the ESC key is pressed, leaving the application
unusable as it cannot be maximized
 - The program doesn't addapt well to different screen sizes. It can be
improved to be more responsive

Notes:
 - AimTrainer.java contains the main logic of the program
 - Target.java constains the circle/target class which is used in AimTrainer.java
